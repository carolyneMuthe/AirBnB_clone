# AirBnB Clone - Command Interpreter

#Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a command-line interpreter for the AirBnB clone. This interpreter will interact with an object storage system that abstracts the persistence layer, meaning that the underlying storage mechanism can be easily changed without affecting the functionality of the application.

The console allows users to create, update, destroy, and manage objects in the AirBnB clone using commands typed directly into the console, either interactively or non-interactively. It is designed as a simple, extensible command-line interface (CLI) that works with Python.
